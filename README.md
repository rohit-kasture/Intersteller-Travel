Intersteller Travel Distance Calculation with minimum path and minimum distance.
We can calculate distance between different Planets in our Galaxy by using Shortest Path algorithm of greedy approach.

In this code we have used Digikstra algorithm to find distance betweeen two nodes in the galaxy with or without traffic. If we calculate with traffic by added delay there could be change in the existing path to travel between Earth(Source)/ Any source to Any Destination.

Here we have React js in the front end to show a easy User Interface to interact for user inputs for source and destination with the Traffic.

Instructrions -

1 - Open the Project in Eclipse or any other IDE or you can run it from the terminal as well if no ide available. 2 - Open React js project foler in the terminal and run -> npm install 3 - Open terminal in the root folder and run -> mvn clean install 4 - Open Target folder where the Jar file gets generated on successful build. 5 - Run Jar file by using command - Java -jar RohitKasture-1.0.0_SNAPSHOT.jar

Note -
When you open the App using localhost:8084. Upload the excel from the APP's User Interface. Then Enter Destination and Select your traffic preference.
Then calculate distance.
